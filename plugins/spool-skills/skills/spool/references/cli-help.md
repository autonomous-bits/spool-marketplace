# CLI help

`spl` is a JSON-oriented CLI: successful command results are written to stdout. The executable
logs failures as structured JSON on stderr and exits non-zero. Help itself is human-readable.

Inspect the installed command surface and flags instead of assuming a release supports a feature:

```sh
spl --help
spl <command> --help
spl merge --help
```

## Repository selection

Every command accepts the persistent global flag:

```text
--state-dir <path>  override the resolved Spool repository state directory
```

Before Cobra dispatches a command, the state directory is selected in this order:

1. `--state-dir <path>` (or `--state-dir=<path>`)
2. `SPOOL_DIR`
3. a validated ancestor `.spl/config.toml` workspace manifest
4. the nearest local `.spl` directory or `go.work` root, or `.spl` in the current directory

An empty `--state-dir` is invalid. A malformed workspace manifest or unknown
workspace ID is an error; checkouts without a workspace manifest use local
repository discovery.

## Working changes

```sh
spl init
spl add --branch main --batch mutations.json
spl status --branch main
spl commit --branch main --author alice --message "Add graph data"
```

`init` creates the resolved repository and default `main` branch.

`add` requires `--branch` and `--batch`, validates a complete JSON mutation-operation array, and
atomically replaces that branch's staged set; it does not commit. Operations can add, update, or
delete nodes and edges. Node operations may carry `labels` and `properties`; edge operations may
carry `type` and `properties`. Property values are tagged recursively with `kind` (`null`, `bool`,
`integer`, `float`, `string`, `list`, or `map`).

```text
add
  --branch <name>  branch on which to stage the batch (required)
  --batch <path>   JSON mutation-operation array (required)
```

`status` reports the staged delta for `--branch` as JSON (an unstaged branch has an empty delta).
`commit` requires `--branch`; `--author` and `--message` provide commit metadata. A successful
commit clears staging. If the canonical transition committed but cleanup or durability reporting
fails, `commit` still writes its JSON result and exits with a durability warning.

```text
status
  --branch <name>  branch whose staged delta to report

commit
  --branch <name>   branch whose staged mutations to commit (required)
  --author <text>   commit author
  --message <text>  commit message
```

## Branches and schemas

```sh
spl branch create feature --from-branch main
spl branch create review --from-commit <commit-id>
spl branch list
spl switch feature
spl branch delete feature
```

`branch create <name>` requires exactly one of `--from-branch` and `--from-commit`.
`branch delete <name>` only deletes an inactive, non-default branch.

```text
branch create <name>
  --from-branch <name>  existing branch source
  --from-commit <id>    existing commit source
branch list
branch delete <name>
switch <branch>
```

Stage a schema and its complete conforming graph mutation batch together:

```sh
spl schema migrate --branch main --schema people.toml --batch people-mutations.json
spl commit --branch main --author alice --message "Migrate people schema"
spl validate --branch main
spl validate --branch main --commit <reachable-commit-id>
```

`schema migrate` requires `--branch`, `--schema`, and `--batch`; rejected migrations leave the
previous staged set unchanged. `validate` requires `--branch`; its optional `--commit` must be
reachable from that branch.

```text
schema migrate
  --branch <name>  branch on which to stage the migration (required)
  --schema <path>  target TOML schema (required)
  --batch <path>   complete JSON mutation-operation array (required)

validate
  --branch <name>  branch to validate (required)
  --commit <id>    reachable commit to validate
```

## Reading graphs

```sh
spl resolve --branch main --node <node-id>
spl resolve --branch main --commit <reachable-commit-id> --node <node-id>
spl graph --branch main
```

`resolve` requires `--branch` and a stable `--node` ID; an optional `--commit` selects a reachable
historical snapshot. `graph` requires `--branch` and exports every node and edge from that branch
snapshot.

```text
resolve
  --branch <name>             branch to resolve (required)
  --commit <id>               reachable commit to resolve
  --node <id>                 stable node entity ID
  --max-rows <n>              maximum rows
  --max-response-bytes <n>    maximum response size
  --timeout <duration>        maximum query duration
  --max-depth <n>             maximum traversal depth
  --max-visited <n>           maximum visited nodes

graph
  --branch <name>  branch to export (required)
```

## Projection retrieval

```sh
spl search --branch main --query incident
spl filter --branch main --label Task --property-text status=open
spl filter --branch main --property-min priority=3
spl search-expand --branch main --query incident --direction out --edge-type RELATES_TO
spl context --branch main --label Task --property-text status=open --direction both
```

`search`, `filter`, `search-expand`, and `context` query only the selected branch-head SQLite/FTS5
projection. Their optional `--commit` is accepted only when it names the current branch head;
historical or divergent snapshots are rejected. `search` requires `--branch` and `--query`.
`filter` requires `--branch`; it accepts repeatable labels and indexed scalar property comparisons.
Each property comparison is `key=value`:

```text
--label <label>                 required node label (repeatable)
--property-text <key=value>     indexed text equality (repeatable)
--property-number <key=value>   indexed numeric equality (repeatable)
--property-min <key=value>      indexed numeric lower bound (repeatable)
--property-max <key=value>      indexed numeric upper bound (repeatable)
```

`search-expand` and `context` require `--branch` and exactly one seed selector: `--query`, or one
or more typed filter flags. `--query` cannot be combined with typed filters. Both commands accept:

```text
--branch <name>                 branch-head projection to query (required)
--commit <id>                   current branch-head selector only
--direction out|in|both         edge direction (default: out)
--edge-type <type>              edge type to traverse (repeatable)
--seed-limit <n>                maximum evidence seeds
--max-depth <n>                 maximum traversal depth
--max-visited <n>               maximum visited nodes
--max-rows <n>                  maximum rows
--max-response-bytes <n>        maximum response size
--timeout <duration>            maximum query duration
```

`search` and `filter` support `--continuation <token>` for another page. `--continuation` is also
available on `history`, `branches-containing`, and `diff`; it is not a flag on `search-expand` or
`context`. Retrieval results include the
pinned snapshot, projection provenance (where applicable), effective budgets, and completion or
truncation metadata. Indexed property filters are available only for scalar schema properties with
`indexed = true`.

## History, containment, and diff

```sh
spl history --branch main --entity-id <node-id>
spl history --branch main --commit <reachable-commit-id> --entity-id <node-id> --all-parents
spl branches-containing --entity-id <node-id>
spl branches-containing --snapshot-id <snapshot-id>
spl branches-containing --natural-key <key>
spl diff --base-branch main --target-branch feature
spl diff --base-branch main --base-commit <base-id> \
  --target-branch feature --target-commit <target-id> --max-rows 100
```

`history` requires `--branch` and `--entity-id`; `--commit` must be reachable from that branch.
`--all-parents` traverses every merge parent instead of the first-parent path. `branches-containing`
requires exactly one of `--entity-id`, `--snapshot-id`, and `--natural-key`.

```text
history
  --branch <name>             branch at which to start (required)
  --commit <id>               reachable starting commit
  --entity-id <id>            stable entity ID (required)
  --all-parents               traverse all merge parents
  --continuation <token>
  --max-rows <n> --max-response-bytes <n> --timeout <duration>

branches-containing
  --entity-id <id>            entity selector
  --snapshot-id <id>          exact snapshot selector
  --natural-key <key>         schema-defined natural-key selector
  --continuation <token>
  --max-rows <n> --max-response-bytes <n> --timeout <duration>
```

`diff` requires `--base-branch` and `--target-branch`; each optional commit must be reachable from
its corresponding branch. It supports `--node-id` and `--edge-id` (repeatable filters),
`--node-title-contains`, `--one-hop`, `--continuation`, `--max-rows`, `--max-response-bytes`, and
`--timeout`.

## Contextual reference assets

```sh
spl asset add --branch main --file docs/architecture.md
spl asset add --branch main --file diagram.svg --title "System topology" --id asset-topology
spl asset read --node asset-topology --branch main > diagram.svg
spl asset read --locator spool://assets/<blake3-hash> > artifact.bin
spl asset read <blake3-hash> > artifact.bin
```

`asset add` requires `--branch` and `--file`. It writes the input into local
`.spl/assets/loose` content-addressable storage, computes a BLAKE3-256 hash and MIME type, and
stages an `Asset` node. The node includes `assetUri`, `byteSize`, `mimeType`, and, when available,
`originalFilename`; the default node ID is `asset-<first-16-hash-characters>`. `--title` and
`--id` override the derived title and node ID.

```text
asset add
  --branch <name>  branch on which to stage the asset node (required)
  --file <path>    reference document to ingest (required)
  --title <text>   descriptive Asset node title
  --id <id>        explicit Asset node ID
```

`asset read` accepts exactly one positional locator/node ID, or `--locator`/`--node`. A locator
may be `spool://assets/<64-lowercase-hex-hash>` or a raw BLAKE3 hash. `--branch` selects the
branch when resolving a node ID and otherwise defaults to the active branch. The command streams
raw bytes to stdout rather than emitting JSON. If the blob is absent locally and a Rack remote is
configured, it is fetched and cached on demand.

```text
asset read [locator-or-node-id]
  --locator <uri-or-hash>  canonical asset URI or raw BLAKE3 hash
  --node <id>              Asset graph node ID
  --branch <name>          branch for node resolution
```

## Merges

Always preserve the preview ID and reuse a caller-owned transaction ID:

```sh
spl merge preview --source feature --target main
spl merge apply --source feature --target main --transaction merge-42 \
  --preview <preview-id> --author alice --message "Merge feature"
spl merge conflicts --target main --transaction merge-42
spl merge resolve --target main --transaction merge-42 --preview <preview-id> \
  --selections selections.json [--overrides mutations.json]
spl merge finalize --target main --transaction merge-42
# or:
spl merge abort --target main --transaction merge-42
```

`preview` requires `--source` and `--target` and does not move refs. `apply` requires
`--source`, `--target`, `--transaction`, and `--preview`; clean previews return a merge commit.
Conflicted previews lease the target branch. `conflicts` inspects the lease, `resolve` requires
`--target`, `--transaction`, `--preview`, and `--selections`, and may take an `--overrides` mutation
array for schema-derived semantic conflicts. `finalize` requires `--target` and `--transaction`;
`abort` requires the same pair and removes the transaction without moving the target.

## Maintenance

```sh
spl fsck
spl gc
spl gc --dry-run
spl gc --repack --grace-period 336h
spl prune --branch feature --dry-run
spl prune --branch feature --author alice --message "Prune transient plan"
spl prune --branch main --force
```

`fsck` is read-only and writes a complete integrity report even when corruption is found; it exits
non-zero for corruption and never repairs data. `gc` retains reachable, reflog, and durable merge
roots, packs retained objects, and prunes only unreachable loose objects after the grace period.
Its flags are `--dry-run`, `--repack`, and `--grace-period` (default `336h`). A committed cleanup
warning still includes the JSON report.

`prune` requires `--branch`, removes nodes marked with the `Ephemeral` modifier label and their
cascading incident edges, and creates a pruning commit when any such nodes are found unless
`--dry-run` is supplied. A zero-match run is an idempotent no-op. `--force` allows pruning the
protected default branch; `--author` and `--message` override commit metadata. It refuses to run
while the branch has staged changes.

## Detached workspaces

```sh
spl workspace init ecommerce-platform
spl workspace attach --workspace ecommerce-platform --repository-id github.com/acme/order-service ~/repos/order-service
```

`workspace init <name>` provisions central detached state. `workspace attach`
requires a central workspace name and portable repository ID, then writes the
repository's `.spl/config.toml` manifest. Commit that manifest so other
checkouts resolve the same central workspace by immutable ID. The command does
not register a host-path attachment.

## Workspace format migration

```sh
spl migrate --from 1 --to 2
spl workspace migrate --from 1 --to 2
```

`migrate` (or `workspace migrate`) upgrades an existing Spool repository state directory to a newer format version. It acquires an exclusive lock on repository control state, creates a timestamped durable backup of the state directory (e.g. `.v1.backup-<timestamp>`), canonicalizes commit objects, remaps references and reflogs, updates configuration format version and tracking metadata, and runs an integrity fsck.

## Remote configuration

```sh
spl remote set --endpoint https://rack.example.com --tenant-id acme --workspace-id prod --auth-mode bearer
spl remote set --endpoint https://rack.example.com --repo-id acme-prod --auth-mode bearer
spl remote show
spl remote remove
```

`remote set` requires `--endpoint`, `--auth-mode` (`bearer` or `api_key`), and either `--workspace-id` (alias `--workspace`), `--tenant-id` (alias `--tenant`), or legacy `--repo-id`, and persists them as a non-secret `[remote]` table in `.spl/config.toml`. It rejects endpoint or identifier values that look like pasted-in credentials (known token prefixes, URL userinfo, overlong identifiers) and never accepts or stores a credential itself.

`remote show` prints the configured remote and probes its `/healthz` endpoint to compare
`packFormatVersion`, `packIndexFormatVersion`, and `packManifestFormatVersion` against this
build's `graphcontract` constants, reporting each as `match`, `mismatch`, or `unknown` (when the
server omits the field). An unreachable endpoint is reported as `versionStatus: "unreachable"`
rather than an error. It never prints a credential.

`remote remove` clears the configured remote and reports whether one existed; it is a no-op when
none is configured.

Credentials are never read from or written to `.spl/config.toml`. When a command needs one, it is
resolved in this order: the OS keychain/secret store (service `spool-rack`, account = workspace/repo-id),
then an environment variable (`SPOOL_RACK_TOKEN` for `bearer`, `SPOOL_RACK_API_KEY` for
`api_key`), then an interactive TTY prompt with hidden input.

## Remote branch management

```sh
spl remote branch create feature --from-branch main
spl remote branch create review --from-commit <commit-id>
spl remote branch list
spl remote branch default
spl remote branch delete feature
```

`remote branch create <name>` creates a remote branch on the configured Rack remote from an existing remote branch or commit, and records local tracking metadata. `remote branch list` lists all branches on the remote. `remote branch default` reports the remote's default branch. `remote branch delete <name>` deletes a remote branch (the remote default branch cannot be deleted).

## Clone

```sh
spl clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/workspaces/ws-backend [directory]
spl clone --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8080 --tenant-id acme --workspace-id ws-backend [directory]
spl workspace clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/workspaces/ws-backend [directory]
```

`clone` (and `workspace clone`) initializes a new local Spool workspace directory, configures the Rack remote, fetches the complete graph history for the default branch (or specified `--branch`), and makes it the active branch. If `[directory]` is omitted, it defaults to the workspace ID or name.

## Push

```sh
spl push --branch main
spl push --branch main --base-commit <last-known-wire-commit-id>
spl push --branch main --reconcile
```

`push` requires `--branch` and a configured Rack remote (`remote set`). It builds a native pack
from every commit reachable from `--branch` that Rack does not yet have, recomputing the Rack
wire-format commit chain (canonical CBOR, BLAKE3 content addressing) from local history on every
invocation — there is no persisted local-to-wire commit mapping yet. `--base-commit` is the last
wire commit ID Rack is known to have for this branch (e.g. a prior push's `headCommit`, or a
rejection's `actualHead`); omit it to push the entire branch history.

`push` only supports linear, fast-forward history: it fails with an error if any commit in the
range being pushed has more than one parent. If the branch is already at `--base-commit`, it
reports `{"pushed": false}` without contacting the remote. If Rack rejects the push because the
branch has moved (a non-fast-forward conflict) and `--reconcile` was not set, `push` reports
`{"pushed": false, "rejected": true, "actualHead": "..."}` with Rack's guidance message rather
than attempting to merge or retry.

With `--reconcile`, a non-fast-forward rejection is instead handled automatically: `push` fetches
Rack's complete current history for `--branch` (a full pull, ignoring any local knowledge of
Rack's state) into a local reconciliation branch named `reconcile/<branch>`, rebases `--branch`'s
independent local changes onto it with the graph merge engine (the same three-way merge `spl
merge preview` uses), and retries the push with the resulting fast-forward-eligible single-parent
commit. A successful reconciled push reports `{"pushed": true, "reconciled": true, ...}`. If the
merge finds conflicts, `push` leaves both `--branch` and `reconcile/<branch>` untouched — no
retry is attempted — and reports `{"reconciled": false, "conflicted": true, "reconciliationBranch":
"reconcile/<branch>", "conflicts": [...]}`; resolve the conflicts with `spl merge
preview/apply/conflicts/resolve/finalize` against `--branch` and `reconcile/<branch>`, then retry
`spl push --branch <branch> --reconcile`. Credentials are resolved the same way as other remote
commands, but unlike `remote show`'s best-effort probe, `push` fails if no credential can be
resolved, since pushing is a state-changing operation.

## Pull

```sh
spl pull --branch main
```

`pull` requires `--branch` and a configured Rack remote (`remote set`). It recomputes the local
branch's current Rack wire-format head commit ID (the same recomputation `push` performs, with no
persisted local-to-wire commit mapping), asks Rack what it has for the branch beyond that commit,
and installs any new commits Rack reports as a fast-forward extension of local history, preserving
each pulled commit's exact original author, message, and time so a later `push` recomputes the same
wire commit IDs Rack already has.

If local history already matches Rack's reported head, `pull` reports `{"pulled": false, "upToDate":
true}` without installing anything. If Rack's branch head is not a descendant of the local branch
(divergence), `pull` reports `{"pulled": false, "diverged": true, "actualHead": "..."}` with Rack's
guidance message rather than attempting a merge — reconciling diverged history is out of scope for
this command. Installing a branch with no local history in common with Rack (a from-scratch
bootstrap) is not yet supported. Credentials are resolved the same way as `push`.

## Version

```sh
spl version
```

`version` prints binary build provenance (release version, commit hash, build date, Go runtime version, and OS/architecture platform) formatted as JSON to standard output without requiring an initialized workspace.

## Completion and help

Generate completion for one of the supported shell subcommands:

```sh
spl completion bash
spl completion zsh
spl completion fish
spl completion powershell
```

`spl help [command path]` prints help for any command, for example `spl help merge apply`.
